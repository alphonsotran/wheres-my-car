# Where's My Car

Where's My Car is a web client that allows you to look for your car through its API. Please run the API server first before running the local server for this web app.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Make sure the API server is running first, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
